# Decided
- **Finalized asset list** for now, can be found in [Asset list Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_iKszOGUwNtrYYG0MVgYB5ns0VCnf4yrHVqgz2o63c/edit?usp=sharing)
- We **don’t need a separate tutorial**, if we feel it’s needed the speech bubble can be reused in the beginning of the game as one.
- Option in either settings menu or main menu to **view controls**.
- **Skill tree is a separate menu** like the pause menu. **Tool tip appears when an upgrade is selected**, if we’re tight on time we can reuse the speech bubble for this as well. Button to open skill tree is still TBD, 
- **Health and mana balls will be a shader** made by *Mons* and concepted by *Remy*.
- “Walk indicator” is made by *Mons*, **not the responsibility of the UI taskforce** but instead Player. *Mons* will further discuss it with *Dexter*. 
- *Mons* will also do the experience bar fill. It shows how close the player is to next level, resets when reached. 
- **Effect when player levels up**, *Mons* responsibility.
- HUD is one image that all the abilities and basic attacks are put on top of when unlocked. **The HUD looks like it has empty slots that the abilities slot into when unlocked**. 
- **Cooldown indicator** will be made by *Mons*.
- Health bar for enemies will be made by *Mons* as well.
- **HUD, enemy health ball, and main menu are the priority** and ideally will be implemented in time for the second playtest.
- Anything visual that isn’t specified to be the responsibility of *Mons* is the responsibility of *Remy*.
