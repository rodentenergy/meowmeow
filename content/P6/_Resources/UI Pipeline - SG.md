# Figma

Make all assets in Figma like usual, try to keep everything named for the most part. When done copy everything that needs to be exported to export file. Go through everything and do the following:
- Delete things that do not need to be exported.
- Group things that need to be exported as one PNG/TARGA.
- Name things so they get the correct name when using FixUI. 
- Add Export on Group or Component.
- Select everything that’s going into the same folder.
- Export!

For example for the play button on the Main Menu. Group the text and button background, name the group ButtonPlay (so it gets renamed to T_mainMenuButtonPlay_C later), then add export on the group (the default settings are fine). When ready to export select everything that’s going to be in the same folder, in this case the Main Menu frame, and export it to that folder. Repeat for all folders.
