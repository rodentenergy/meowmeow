	- I love this fucking app it’s so good ughhH!! Please check it out if you need to keep a bunch of reference images handy and organized into folders and/or tags. Listen I’m all for self hosted and open source software but you can pry Eagle from my cold dead hands. YOU CAN SEARCH ALL YOUR IMAGES BY COLOR???? THAT’S SO COOL! Oh, also here’s some screenshots of my eagle.
