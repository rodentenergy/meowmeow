# UI Thoughts
- Something painted for the main menu? A cut out of some sort? Selected images from Miro board to use as main references:

# UI Mockup Menus -  First Draft
![[mockupFirstDraft.png]]
I just realized I accidentally wrote 4 twice, that was not on purpose. Whoops, too late to do anything about it now though :shrug:

## UI Feedback First Draft
- Which mockups people like most:

| Mockup | How many? |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1      | 2         |
| 2      | 2         |
| 3      | 3         |
| 4      | 1         |
| 6      | 3         |
### Dexter Feedback
#### Background/Feel
- Background in 6 is cool, and also represents the game more.
- 1 is cool but doesn’t represent the game as much.
- 3 feels too retro, 4 too simple and 5 too try hard on the spider theme.
#### Title font
- 1 is cool, 5 is cool but cliche, 3/5 are too hard to read, 2 is fine but generic, and 4 is too brutalist.
#### Buttons
- 2s are the best, they’re simple and easy to read, their left-alignment also gives more focus to the image to the right. 
- 2s buttons are also easy to read because of their size, the buttons should be kept at this size so they’re easy to read. **Especially if they’re not centered on the screen**. 
- 3s buttons are also nice since they’re centered which gives more focus to them. The font on them is also easy to read and clear *but* could be a bit wider.
- 6s buttons are too close to each other, 1s are too retro-like, 5s are too squeezed together (there’s also a ton happening around them), 4s buttons are a bit small and the right-alignment is a bit odd since there’s nothing to show off to the left (such as art).
### Misc. Feedback
- 3 is more Diablo like, 1 fits the game well. Combine gothic theme from 3 with psychedelic vibe from 1?

### Feedback Takeaways
#### Mockup 1 = 2 people
- Cool doesn’t represent the game that much.
- Cool, represents the game but not very gothic or Diablo like.
#### Mockup 2 = 2 people
- Generic title font
- Easy to read buttons, ideal button size. Left-alignment gives more focus to image.
#### Mockup 3 = 3 people
- Background/vibe is too retro.
- Title font is hard too read.
- Buttons are nice since they’re centered which gives them more focus. The button font is easy to read *but* could be a *bit* wider.
- Diablo like.
#### Mockup 4 (not an actual contender)
- Too simple
- Left-alignment off buttons feel weird since there’s nothing (like art) to show off to the right.
#### Mockup 5 = 1 person
- Too try hard on the spider theme.
- Buttons too squeezed together, there’s also a lot of noise around them.
#### Mockup 6 = 3 people
- Background is cool since it’s directly linked to the game and shows off our player character.
- Buttons are too close together.
# UI Mockup Menus - Iterate on first draft
## Plan of Action
- Main inspiration is <font color="#ffd1d1">number 6</font>, big *<u>focus on nice intricate logo</u>*!! Get more references and examples. Check how Final Fantasy does the rest of their UI as well.
- Based on the buttons from <font color="#ffd1d1">number 2</font>.
- Colors from <font color="#ffd1d1">number 1</font> and <font color="#ffd1d1">number 2</font>?
- **Less corporate** and more handmade vibes.
- Buttons right or center aligned.
