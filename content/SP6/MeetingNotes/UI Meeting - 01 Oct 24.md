# General question
- **UI pipeline?**

I make the UI, export it and then I use the ImGUI program Marja is making to draw out where everything is on the screen which gets exported to a JSON file that tells the code that information.

- **Should all text be made by me and saved as .DDS files or do I give SP the font and they handle it?**

To start with text in-game will be sprites but support for fonts will be added later so weâ€™ll switch over whenever that is.
# Questions about specific parts of UI
- **How should the resolution setting be done? Dropdown meny? Carousel**?

A carousel with arrows on either side that cycle through all the options.
