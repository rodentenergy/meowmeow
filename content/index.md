Welcome, yay!! :3

This is my personal wiki with things I want to access easily anywhere, and also stuff I want to share with others easily. Almost everything that isn’t meant to be explicitly shared is unfinished.

Here’s the pages that’ll probably be most useful to other people:
- [[FixUI Documentation]]
- [[UI Resources]]

Here’s links to all the folders for navigation on mobile:
- <a href="/P6">Spite: Web of Decay - Main folder</a>
	- <a href="/P6/_Resources">Spite: Web of Decay - Resources</a>
	- <a href="/P6/_Work/UI">Spite: Web of Decay - Work notes UI</a>
	- <a href="/P6/MeetingNotes">Spite: Web of Decay - Meeting notes</a>
- <a href="/APP/Pre-prod">APP - Research and planning</a>
- <a href="/_Resources">Resources</a>
