# Plan
Make UI, implement in unity, make it fancy and animated :thumbsup:
I want to make all screens and HUD that’s needed for navigation all menus (make a screen flow as well) as well as at least one full HUD screen but preferably more. It also needs a logo. It should be fully functional (maybe not HUD).
